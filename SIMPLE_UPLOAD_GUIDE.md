# Simple GitHub Upload Guide

## Option 1: Use Replit's Built-in GitHub Integration

1. **Connect GitHub to Replit**:
   - Click the version control icon (looks like a branch) in the left sidebar
   - Click "Connect to GitHub"
   - Select "Create a new GitHub repository"
   - Name it `d4youpromogame`
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push Your Code**:
   - Replit will automatically push all your files to GitHub
   - This includes all the fixed asset imports

## Option 2: Manual File Upload (if Option 1 doesn't work)

### Essential Files to Upload Manually:

**Root Directory Files:**
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config.ts
- tailwind.config.ts
- postcss.config.js
- components.json
- drizzle.config.ts
- .env.example
- .gitignore
- README.md
- RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md

**Create these folders on GitHub and upload:**

1. **client/** folder - Upload entire folder contents
2. **server/** folder - Upload entire folder contents  
3. **shared/** folder - Upload entire folder contents
4. **attached_assets/** folder - Upload entire folder contents

## Option 3: Use GitHub Desktop (Recommended)

1. Download GitHub Desktop from github.com
2. Create new repository on GitHub.com called `d4youpromogame`
3. Clone it to your computer using GitHub Desktop
4. Copy all files from this Replit project to the cloned folder
5. Commit and push through GitHub Desktop

## After Upload: Railway Deployment

1. Go to railway.app
2. "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your `d4youpromogame` repository
4. Add PostgreSQL service
5. Set environment variable: `RESEND_API_KEY`
6. Deploy!

**The asset import issue has been fixed, so Railway deployment will work properly now.**
